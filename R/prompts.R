*** DASHBOARD RULES ***
  1. Make sure all plots can be plotted as `ggplot` objects.
  2. **Plot Types**:
    - scatter plots: must have only quantitatives on the x and y axes, and an optional 3rd categorical with n_distinct <= 3 or quantitative column for colour (if you use a quantitative for colour, specify to use a continuous colour scale).
    - line plot: must have a DateTime column on the x-axis, a quantitative on the y axis, and an optional 3rd categorical column with n_distinct <= 3 for colour.
    - box plots: must have a categorical on the x-axis, a quantitative on the y axis, and an optional 3rd categorical column with n_distinct <= 3 for separate y-axes or grouped box plots, or an optional 3rd quantitative column to be plotted on a separate y axis.
    - histogram: must have a quantitative on the x-axis in bins, counts on the y axis, and an optional 2nd categorical column with n_distinct <= 3 for stacked bars, multiple axes, or colour.
    - bar chart: must have a categorical on the x-axis and counts on the y axis, and an optional 3rd categorical column with n_distinct <= 3 for stacked bars or multiple axes.

  3. **Column Types**:
    - Quantitative variables must be numeric or integers and must not have the type 'Categorical' in the summary.
    - Categorical variables must have the type 'Categorical' in the summary.
    - For columns with the type 'Large Categorical' or 'Free Text', specify how to select the 10 most interesting categories (e.g. the 10 most expensive car brands).
    - Any variables referenced in plot descriptions must also be in the provided summary and list of input columns. Never reference a variable that does not correspond to a specific column.
    - n_distinct in the summary must be <= 3 to use a column for additional colouring, grouping, or separate y-axes to avoid visual clutter.

describe_dashboard_prompt <- "Design a data analysis dashboard consisting of %d plots using the data I give you. 

Explore the dataset with a variety of data analysis plots. Choose plots that give a broad and diverse view of the dataset, highlighting different aspects and relationships.

Ensure the plots each show different relationships by varying them as much as possible using different plot types and different columns, e.g. do not just use scatter plots or repeatedly show the same column on an axis.

As a guideline, include no more than 2 of the same plot type.

improve_dashboard_prompt <- "Can you improve the previous response by replacing plot descriptions and their input columns according to the following guidelines:

1. **Compliance with DASHBOARD RULES**:
   - Ensure all plots adhere to the previously stated DASHBOARD RULES.
   - Replace any plots that do not follow these rules.
   - Remove any additional categorical columns used for colouring, grouping, or separate y-axes, which have n_distinct > 3 to avoid visual clutter

2. **Logical Sense**:
   - Replace any plots that do not make logical sense (e.g. a plot using an ID number as a continuous value).

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Where appropriate and not present already, add or improve existing visual enhancements:
     - If they have at most 3 distinct categories (n_distinct <= 3) and are logically relevant, add categorical columns from the summary to show relationships across different categories. Explain how these should be used.
     - For large categorical variables (e.g. more than 10 categories), avoid using them for colour or separate y-axes. Instead, summarise the data by selecting the top categories based on a relevant metric (e.g. top 10 regions by sales).
     - Add 95%% prediction ellipses per category for any scatter plots that have a categorical column for colour.
     - Add lines of best fit with 95%% confidence intervals to line plots, and scatter plots without categories.
     - Be creative to make the plots more interesting and insightful.

4. **Redundancy and Variety**:
   - Replace any redundant or highly similar plots with different plots.
   - Ensure there are %d plots in total. Add new plots if the number of plots is insufficient.

generate_code_prompt <- "I want to create this plot: %s
    Please provide a function in R called 'plot_df' that takes a dataframe 'df' as its argument, processes it, and returns a ggplot object.
    The function must use tidyverse packages where relevant to perform preprocessing, data transformation, statistical analyses, and plotting.
    Preprocessing includes:
      - Converting numeric variables to factors with as.factor() when used categorically.
      - For scatter, box, and line plots, removing outliers and downsampling remaining data to 1000 rows when count > 1000, applying strategic downsampling if a categorical variable is present.
      - Creating derived variables when necessary, such as computing aggregates, differences, or ratios that may enhance the plot.
      - Handling missing values by imputation or removal, based on their extent and nature.
      - Any additional grouping, aggregation, or summarisation required.

    *** STYLING RULES ***
      - Box plots should always be coloured by category.
      - Never colour by count.
      - Use `facet_wrap` when separate y-axes are specified.
      - Prediction ellipses must be drawn with `ggplot2::stat_ellipse` with default asthetics.
      - Always use `theme_grey`
      - When colouring categoricals, use the `Set3` colour palette from `RColorBrewer`.
      - Only when asked for a continuous colour scale, use `scale_colour_gradient(low = 'blue', high = 'red')`.
      - Make the first colour from the `Set3` palette the default plotting colour, including for scatter plots.
      - Continuous numeric ticks must be rounded to 2 decimal places
      - X axis ticks must be rotated.

    *** OUTPUT RULES ***
      - The response should consist of only the R code for the `plot_df` function without comments, formatted as a fenced R code block, like so:
      ```r
        plot_df <- function(df) { your code here }
      ```
      - Include library requirements in the function code with require() statements.
      - The `plot_df` function must return only a `ggplot` object.
      - All plots must have a concise title and axes must be labelled.
      - DO NOT include comments in the code.

Try be creative and use your own knowledge to draw insights into the purpose of the data for the executive summary, rather than stating direct observations from the csv summary.

Then identify and list any columns from the summary which are useless for data science, such columns with very low information or high num_na.

In this list, include identifier columns - these are columns which are used purely for identifying individual items, they will include words such as id or code and have a high `n_distinct`.

Scatter and line plots must have continuous x and y axes and an optional category, but never a 'Categorical' on an axis.
